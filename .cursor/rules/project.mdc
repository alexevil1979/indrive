description: RideHail monorepo — DDD, Clean Architecture, zero questions mode
globs: ["**/*"]
---
- Use DDD + Clean Architecture in every service.
- Backend: Go 1.23+ primary; TypeScript/Node only for real-time/fast-iteration.
- API: gRPC internal, REST/JSON public, GraphQL for complex queries.
- Never ask clarifying questions; choose production-grade 2026 defaults and document in comments.
- Commits: conventional (feat:, fix:, refactor:).
